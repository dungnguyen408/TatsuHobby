# TatsuHobbyUi


Purpose: I wanted to redo the www.tatsuhobby.com layout for my own personal use. This will help me hone my skills as a designer. 

Tasks: 
-To create the basic layout for their website. 
-Add wireframe to the layout
-Finish the prototype using Adobe XD
-Extra time: Create this layout using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

Goal: I wanted the UI to look similar to major shopping websites. Examples I used were other hobby and clothing store websites.

**Note: Still edits need to be done
